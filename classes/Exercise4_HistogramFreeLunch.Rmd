This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Load the data 
```{r}
link='https://github.com/EvansDataScience/VisualAnalytics_2_tabularData/raw/master/data/eduwa.rda'

#getting the data TABLE from the file in the cloud:
load(file=url(link))
```

Create the dataframe 
```{r}
eduwa1=eduwa[complete.cases(eduwa$Free.Lunch),]
dataHist=hist(eduwa1$Free.Lunch)
```

```{r}
hist(eduwa1$Free.Lunch,labels = T,xlab="Free Lunch")
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

base= ggplot(eduwa1,aes(x = Free.Lunch))  
h1= base + geom_histogram()
h1 
```

```{r}
dataHist
```

To see what was used to build the GGPlot Histogram of Free.Lunch
```{r}
ggplot_build(h1)$data[[1]]
```

```{r GGplotFree.Lunch, eval=FALSE}
#ggplot
base= ggplot(eduwa1,aes(x = Free.Lunch))  
h1= base + geom_histogram(breaks=seq(0, 1780, 20), 
                          boundary=0, 
                          col="red", 
                          fill="blue", 
                          alpha=.3, 
                          na.rm = TRUE, 
                          inherit.aes = TRUE)

h1= h1 + stat_bin(binwidth = 20, aes(label=..count..), cex=1.8, 
                  geom = "text", boundary = 0,vjust=-0.5)

h1= h1 + labs(title="WA Schools Providing Free Lunch", subtitle =sourceText, x="Quantity of Free Lunches", y="Number of Schools") + 
  xlim(c(0,1000))+
  ylim(c(0,360))

h1

```

```{r}
h2 = h1 + scale_x_continuous("Quantity of Free Lunches", breaks=seq(0, 1000, 100), limits = c(0,1000))

h2
```


```{r}
#base
hist(eduwa1$Free.Lunch, labels = T,xlab="Free Lunch")
```

```{r}
hist(eduwa1$Free.Lunch,labels = T, xlab = "Free Lunch", xaxt="n")
axis(side=1, at=dataHist$breaks)
```

```{r}
freq(eduwa1$Free.Lunch, style = "rmarkdown", report.nas = F)

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
